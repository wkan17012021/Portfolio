During this week, I have involved in a few tasks across the board with good variety. I proof read a couple of deliverables from other teams to give them feedback and catch any errors. For myself, I prepared some project task description documentation as a way of showcasing some of the technical skills learned on the job, this doc will supplement the end-point assessment portfolio. 
I prepared and presented a short in-house team talk on Storybook software. As a team, we are trying to build up the knowledge pool so all colleagues can at least get the level of competence to use each software and perform run-of-the-mill tasks. I chose to discuss a high level overview of Storybook and some of the plugins, because I hadn't used it before so it would be good to add to my front-end toolkit. 

We spent some time as a team researching Webforms module translation for our Drupal site. We require a default english form to be available in 4 other languages, so we were scouring forums, contacting other developers etc. to see if anyone had done this before. This one is work in progress..

I had another "lesson learned episode": when creating blocks for the masthead in block layout, remember to access the pages tab in configuration which you can use to specify the URL where you want this particular masthead block to appear in. So, you could set a number of URLs or do the opposite- add the URLs to exclude this block from. If you leave this option blank which is what I did, Drupal assumes you want that block content to appear on all pages! Needless to say, after this change was saved, there was an unhappy and confused content editor moments later! 

Due to the run up to Easter break, we are short staffed so we are not clearing as many tickets from the sprint as we would like. But, that downtime does give me opportunity to progress on some online learning courses. I completed the PHP course on CodeCademy as well as the UX and UI course, so I look forward to implementing what I learned in the workplace.
