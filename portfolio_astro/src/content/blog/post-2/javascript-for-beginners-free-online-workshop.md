This was an open event held by Le Wagon Bootcamp provider and Eventbrite.

To be honest, I attended this session because I wanted to get the instructor’s opinion / thoughts on AJAX and JQuery. Unfortunately, the presentation overran on subjects like JS variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, objects such that there was no time to discuss AJAX or Jquery!

Maybe this was deliberate as going through the earlier topics wasn't smooth sailing. I don't blame the presenter though as the open invite meant there were many elementary questions which were somewhat easy for the presenter to answer which ate up time. It's important to solidify the fundamentals before moving on to more complex topics.

## Learn how to query databases with SQL (17:30 - 19:30 | 27/10/2021)
Le Wagon ran this Eventbrite session and at the time I was about to cover SQL in the bootcamp. So this presentation was a nice refresher on the language and on relational databases.

The majority of the talk was on basic commands already covered in the bootcamp and a bit of work history on the instructor. The aim of the session was to encourage viewers to sign up to the bootcamp.
