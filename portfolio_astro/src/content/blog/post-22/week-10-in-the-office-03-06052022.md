This week has certainly been relaxing due to the public holiday and nice weather- to experience four seasons in one day in the UK is not unusual ðŸ˜ƒ

I have been investing a lot of my time on learning SASS. Our legacy codebase uses the preprocessor language and recently, a few visual defects have been spotted on some of the webpages which could be down to restrictive frontend framework designs (we have Bootstrap sprinkled in there) or the way the SASS is written. To add to the confusion, there are Tailwind prefixes being used as we migrate from the older styling methods to using TW css in the future. Suffice to say, it's a bit of a spiders web of code, but perhaps that is something you come to expect as a developer. There is a silver lining, I have an excuse to learn SASS and I may well be involved in refurbishing the styling for a large web project- all good for experience!

To tackle this, I used a blend of youtube ([Kevin Powell,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4cECvhrBo8) [Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4&t=1948s) and a few other less well-known videos to check consistency), documentation, Codecademy's Learn SASS course and a whole lot of trial and error. To cement this skill, I will build an SPA using SASS and follow best practices whilst using the additional features that aren't yet available in native css. Hopefully, I will have a stronger foundation to begin editing the website codebase with confidence. 

We also had our sprint planning meeting this week. Due to the public holidays, it has been difficult to get all team members together for discussion or collaboration. As a result, some issues were blocked, others waiting for code review. We were happy with the last sprint given the circumstances. We then talked through some of the issues in the backlog in terms of complexity and therefore time taken to resolve the ticket. We divvied up the issues we could manage in the timeframe and kept the lower priority jobs for next sprint.
