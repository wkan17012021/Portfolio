A brief on a project-specific task whilst working for One Young World.

## Situation

Content writers for One Young World, require a landing page for a project called National Boards (herein referred to as ‘NB’). The aim of the landing page is to promote One Young World in countries that have been identified as being underrepresented in terms of their contribution to the organisation’s mission. They then can gain greater recognition for the social impact that the leaders of that country are responsible for. 

The landing page is needed to promote the countries and leaders who have pledged to become National Boards. Additional subsidiary pages are required to showcase the country's board members.

## Task

in meetings, I worked with team members to draw out salient information missing from the briefing document that was required for the build. I offered my advice for design, user experience and web accessibility considerations, whilst serving the needs of the content team. 

The following sub-tasks were agreed on and needed to be completed by myself:

* display the NB Chairs/Leaders which should be automated as more Leaders are added in the future;
    
* each country's NB Page should have a content area of the NB Chair and beneath that, a styled display of the NB Members which should also be automated;
    
* a way for users on the NB landing page to enquire more about the process of becoming a National Board affiliate organisation under One Young World or just to find more information.
    

## Action

* With help from senior staff, I learned to break down the project into more manageable, time-boxed tasks which were clearly displayed as tickets in our Jira board.
    
* Became familiar with Drupal Views Core Module which enabled me to pull the necessary people from the database by content type: board member. I filtered this initial list using knowledge of Drupal's taxonomy system (filtering by people with the taxonomy term National Board Chair or National Board Member). I then sorted alphabetically and rendered the views template output on the front end.
    
* Implemented flex-row-based responsive web design with media queries.
    

## Result

Delivered the project within the timeframe and received positive feedback from the content team.
