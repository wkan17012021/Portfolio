This really was an inspirational talk by [Eduardo Vedes](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/changing-careers-the-path-to-becoming-a-web-developer-tickets-259383381677?aff=ebdsoporgprofile#) giving honest, "un-sugar coated" professional experience on his journey to software and web development. This event was hosted by Ironhack in collaboration with Eventbrite.

A lot of the talking points although were second-guessed, they helped to dispel myths around the industry or preconceptions I held. Mostly, how development is very well marketed at being a cushy, flexible job and the stereotype that the computer does all your work for you. Or, that you can definitely get a well-paying job just from a bootcamp course. Although this maybe the case for some, it is worth mentioning that success stories are always marketed well- for every learner coder that broke through into employment, how many failed or are still trying to make the break through?

The take home message: your success is a function of your commitment to learning programming. How determined are you in the face of failure / rejection? How resourceful are you around continued learning?

He also offered tips to improve your marketability and soft skills development.

Big thanks to Eduardo and the Ironhack marketing team for arranging this free, online session.
