I have my lead developer to thank for passing on the details to this 2 day online free event and I was so happy I got to attend and enjoy so many thought-provoking presentations. Big shout out to CodeNewbie for arranging it and all of the sponsors for financially supporting the conference: quite rightly stated, without their support, events like these wouldn't be possible. 

A lot of the talks were purely inspirational and language-agnostic, focussing more on the next generation of developers and engineers: what can they bring to the discussion which is different from the previous generation and what values and opinions do they value the most? The target audience is early career starters, students, even those interested in the field but are on the fence about diving straight in. 

I picked up several learning resources which I'll spend time reviewing (a number of useful sources on accessibility as this was a much discussed topic but one where I do not have a lot of practical coding experience with). 

The organisers made the communication via the webpage and discord channel really accessible and easy to engage with other participants and sponsors. I could see that the turnout of listeners were truly international and it goes to show that the explosion of online events recently has captured this massive audience, enabling those who traditionally would not geographically or financially be available to attend in-person, can now do so from the comfort of their homes. The time zone difference may not be ideal for you, but to deliver a series of engaging talks (for free) and a networking event literally at your fingertips, speaks volumes about how progressive development communities like CodeNewbie and Dev.to are and how advanced the web and software industry is as a whole. The 2 day event was thoroughly enjoyed and worth the time.
