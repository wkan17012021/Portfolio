Local libraries are great underrated resources for acquiring knowledge without parting with your cash. I wanted to get some crash-course style teaching with these books and supplement the notes I have built up already with online resources. The literature is appropriate to the absolute beginner but would serve the purpose of refreshing your coding skills for building static sites. I read through these books from August 2021 to January 2022 before and during my bootcamp and would recommend (in no particular order) for someone perhaps going through the early bootcamp phase or through the self-study route:
