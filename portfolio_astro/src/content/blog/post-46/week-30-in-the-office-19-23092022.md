It was good to get back into the swing of development this week. We are trying to iron out those backlogged code reviews sitting on the scrum board for months before we as a team start a new 2-week sprint which I'm also looking forward to researching and developing/iterating on our pattern library in Storybook. We have an existing library, but it doesn't follow the atomic design described by Brad Frost, especially when it comes down to atom units. For example, we find we have a few different styled buttons on the live site, which is quite confusing. It will be great to spend time on this as I tried to implement a Drupal starter theme with a functioning Storybook pattern library and realised two important aspects: 1) I am not familiar as I thought with taking the storybook design and placing them into a Drupal webpage. It turns out after researching the matter that Drupal requires more steps to implement stories.js into twig files compared to other JavaScript libraries like Vue and React. 2) I have no idea how to install, configure or set up Storybook to work with Drupal. I found some documentation on our notion library, which may help to get up and running with it, though. 

We are still tying up some admin tasks and generating personal feedback and feedback from our users with regard to the experience of the summit event in early September. It was certainly an experience, and I'm happy to put it behind me and focus on what I am interested in working on, which is website development and maintenance.

I pushed on independently with my <map> problem with an image and clickable areas. It can be placed on a Drupal page; the styling and Javascript have been included in the page also- so the functionality is there. There are a couple of styling tweaks that need to be made first. The next step is to make this custom code more reusable, maintainable (can the content writer prepare the image and interactive regions via a WYSIWYG editor?) and scalable. 

There is talk again about overhauling the current website frontend design because there are many inconsistencies with branding assets and some unintuitive content creation user journeys. We have been asked to begin self-study in web design which should be fun!
A project like this takes a significant amount of time and collaboration in-house and amongst content teams, so we'll see if this comes to fruition or not.
