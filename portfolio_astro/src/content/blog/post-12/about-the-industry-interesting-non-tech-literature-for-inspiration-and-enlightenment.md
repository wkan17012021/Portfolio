Ok, it's about tech! But this post is for note-worthy resources that dive into the experiences and attitudes of generations of coders to give a different perspective on the industry and hopefully, their words of wisdom will support me on my road to becoming a [fully-fledged developer](https://the-dog-can-blog.hashnode.dev/becoming-a-full-fledged-developer-a-long-and-winding-road)💪🏽

[Clive Thompson's 'Coders: Who They Are, What They Think and How They Are Changing Our World'](https://www.waterstones.com/book/coders/clive-thompson/9781529019001)

This is in my opinion, an excellent deep-dive into the mindset of the generation of 90s, 00s coders and what the future coder will look and behave like. To the seasoned developer, it's sure to strike moments of nostalgia. For the newbie, enlightenment and appreciation of the environment they are delving into.

There is mention of popular developers responsible for coming up with programming languages and numerous apps and websites that we are familiar with. Clive interviews and describes their story in detail trying to give the reader the point of view of the coder.

Clive explores the stigma and stereotypes around those involved in this development sphere and what dangerous and harmful ramifications have had on software businesses. Some of the other topics he discusses include sexist workplaces, meritocracy, rockstar programmers, radicalisation and extremism, bootcamps and degrees.

A must-read for those stepping into the industry or on the fence, so that you can view the world of development through those who have survived it rather than via the lens of an IT recruiter or marketing campaign.
