SMR 2022 was a great success for me and definitely fulfilled my expectations from a tech event. I first heard about it during my time in the bootcamp, as I was then thinking about ways to promote myself actively and network with potential employers. Covid made things difficult so SMR was postponed to May. I was keeping one eye on my emails waiting for that e-ticket to come through letting me know I can attend the free event. 

I got my ticket around two weeks from the event: I was allowed to go on Sunday based on the survey I took which funnelled me into the profile of developer / engineer. Saturday was reserved for tech management and CTOs. It would have been nice to have the confirmation in advance but I imagine it is a logistical nightmare to arrange so I wasn't too beat up about it. 

The venue appeared to be an old multi-storey car park belonging to a brewery in Brick Lane, North-East-ish London, which the team refurbished nicely with big colourful signage, coffee and drinks stands, bar-style chat tables, arcade games and even a ball pit for those who brought their kids!

As for the main hall, it was two halls on one level in the car park lined with company pop-up stands and promotional game areas. There were about 200 stands (some larger establishments took up multiple stalls), free food and drink, sitting areas, cloakroom, toilets etc. So, they have thoughtfully arranged all the necessities that you may need at an event like this considering you will probably be here for several hours.

I think I went round about 4 or 5 times just to make sure I didn't miss any companies whilst awkwardly avoiding those that I had just spoken to! They probably wouldn't remember me: the conversations although felt natural and fluid mostly, from the representative position it must feel scripted and kind of like a production line talking about the same topics. 

I was in a privileged position since I wasn't actively looking for a role, rather to network, enjoy the positive energy and learn about trends in the London tech industry. I wanted also to get an idea of the technologies that software companies are using and how that shapes the type of roles on offer.

Here are some of my observations and useful hints at making the day as productive for you as possible:

- There didn't appear to many (or any that I spoke to) junior positions on offer. Most openings were mid- and senior level. Being junior or entry-level myself, it was disappointing to hear this but not unexpected. It makes me appreciate getting a junior position and eludes to the learning path that I need to continue on to reach that career step where I can be more marketable. Don't let the lack of junior roles deter you, explain your position and tease out the possibility of the the recruiter 'making' less-experienced positions for you. A lot of the companies are start-ups who need team members with some tech skills but really with drive and willing to do the hard yards to make the firm successful and grow. 

- Don't expect an in-depth discussion on any particular role. The representatives sometimes are from HR so they are not usually privy to things like salary expectations, work culture etc. But you can ask general things that may help you decide if you can see yourself working at that business: 
Where is the office based? What are the WFH arrangements?
How big is the dev team? What's the ratio of junior to senior staff?
What's the training and mentoring schemes like?
What hardware and software is being used to deliver projects?
Are there any standout projects the company are proud of?


- Be personal. Appreciate that the spokesperson has given up their weekend to speak with strangers desperate for a job! They would have spoken to many people before you and many people after you. So, take the lead on the conversation (it gives them time to recover their voice) and explain your career situation. Thank them for taking the time out of their weekend and representing their business. Try to leave with a name (LinkedIn or email) from the firm, not just a link to their careers page. The added personal touch and natural conversation will help them remember you and aids your chance of securing an interview. 

- Bring a water bottle, comfortable shoes, face mask + alcohol hand gel for obvious reasons. Grab all the SWAG you can carry and enjoy yourself!
