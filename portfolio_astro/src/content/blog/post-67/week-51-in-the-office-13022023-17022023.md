## Work-based Tasks

* Style-based changes on this homepage masonry task: adding new fields for a shortened content title, accessing that through the Drupal Views module, rendering through the templating engine and subsequently styling it as a grid item in a nested grid container.
    
* Content copy changes to support our other teams.
    

## Personal Project

To showcase a Drupal project I created for future interviews, I have decided to diverge from my previous GitHub Project: The Road Less Travelled. This was a geological-themed travel website but I had to come up with the content and media, and then design and develop myself using React.js. I found this to be a laborious and frictional process and doesn't serve my end goal of learning how to become a site builder in the Drupal ecosystem and showcasing my learning journey to future employers.

Instead, I researched a couple of travel sites with a geological or hiking theme. I stumbled upon GeoWorld Travel, which appears to be a mostly static site using PHP and very little in the way of frameworks. After a glance at the material, I felt this site could certainly do with a revamp and it should be within my capabilities to redevelop it in a more composable manner.

I mocked up a sitemap to understand the user journey and it sparked a few questions on data reusability. The screenshot of the sitemap is below and hard to read the text due to the number of pages- as it became apparent that the site has more content on separate pages and they tend to link to one another.

This was a useful exercise as it required some Drupal details to be ironed out:

* Can Taxonomy help characterise and filter the relations between each place (destination) content type and feature content type? The destination is the country or place name. 'Feature' in this website context would be a particular attraction e.g. glaciers, mountains, caves.
    
* I think the "content" for each of the Feature pages could be rendered with Drupal Views. This requires additional reference fields in the Destination type.
    
* Most feature pages have several contextual images. But these do not necessarily appear on the corresponding destination page. We need a way to auto-pull these images into feature pages. Even if this means adding these media to the destination page.
    
* Some features e.g. Northern Lights, Ophiolite and Petrified Wood, have only a couple of relevant destinations. How can we reduce the site map where a page for this content is not warranted?
    
* How can we automate the testimonial data so they conditionally appear on appropriate pages? Reviews have come from social media and privately to the owner via email. The emails would have to be manually input, perhaps with Drupal Layout Builder. But can the others be pulled in with an API? Also, the layout and styling need a redesign.
    
* The homepage could showcase a few popular destinations and features, but it would be nice to have a search facility which can return destinations based on associated features and vice-versa.
    

The next step is to draw out a roadmap or project plan and try to outline as many of the steps that are required to push this project through each stage of the software development cycle.
