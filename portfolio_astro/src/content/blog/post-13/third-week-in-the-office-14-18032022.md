This week at work was all about gaining efficiency in the workflow (Jira ticketing system, Git commands and producing informative notes to aid the process).

# Version Control
To support my learning, I have started [CodeCademy's Git and GitHub course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git), so I can reinforce the basic commands our team uses to create and push changes to the remote repository. I hope that it will give me an holistic approach to source control and best practice for documentation. I'm learning about Markdown for making illustrative and human-readable 'Readme' files. Although, I may not be doing that in my workplace, the skill should be transferrable for Merge Requests.

The focus is more on the CLI as it has dawned on me that IDEs come and go out of fashion and there will always be a period of learning and familiarisation. Why hinder yourself when you can use the git commands right out of the CLI straight away?

## Tailwind and Storybook Progress
I continued improving my turnaround for some basic components into Storybook builder template. It was fun to tweak and problem solve these UI features without time pressure. It was certainly an iterative process I'm familiar with.

## Admin and Meetings
We had a new apprentice developer with us this week and so it was great to speak with someone who has been through a similar process as myself. It's good to bounce ideas of each other and pick up tips and tricks which I would not have known while self studying. So, a large portion of the time was spent helping my colleague with onboarding and answering questions.

I also had several meetings to give me more context on the teams responsibilities and a steer in my apprenticeship training.

It was good to know that on top of the programmed online classroom style lessons, I was also allowed one-to-one sessions with the instructor for specific technical problems and timely reviews of my portfolio. But, there was emphasis on learning off-the-job and reading around the subject. Right now, I'm spread across learning the CMS UI, the language that powers the CMS, config, learning Git and learning React (this one is just for fun though ðŸ˜†). I have concerns that it will take me longer to finish these courses rather than sticking to one language, so I'll have to gauge my progress after a few weeks and reassess.

We also discussed the organisation's online platform for virtual conference hosting. The UI was slick, intuitive and reasonably customisable. I'm looking forward to having a look around on it and observing the interactivity when the event goes live. It will be our team's responsibility to monitor viewer interactions, help upload and correct content and be available as **tech support**.
