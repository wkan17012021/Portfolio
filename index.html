              Python3, SQL and mySQL Workbench, NoSQL and MongoDB.

                HTML5 is the first language that I learned which sparked my
                interest in programming and coding. Being a consumer of
                software and the Internet for most of my life, I was amazed by
                how straightforward it was to instantly observe (or not
                observe!) the output and the vast array of content you can add
                to the page layout. It was very much an "Alice Through the
                Looking Glass" moment! HTML5 is an effective language for
                learning programming by doing. With it, i was able to
                appreciate how modern websites are organised in terms of their
                content and factored in semantic elements to improve search
                engine optimisation.

                CSS is where you can really show off your artistic flair. I
                got to grips with the syntax, about appropriate use of
                selectors and inheritance, when to use flexbox or grid
                stucture layouts and finally adding my animations and styling
                for that personal touch. The projects which included CSS were
                minimalistic in design, simple but effective colour themes,
                with the aim to make the content more accessible. It was
                necessary to use styling to entice readers and not to detract
                from web products and services. I also gained an appreciation
                of responsive web design and utilised a Bootstrap Framework to
                expediate front-end web design output. CSS is an important
                asset for any front-end developer seeking to provide a premium
                user experience.

                With a foundation of the web content structure, layout and
                styling appearance, I applied JavaScript fundamental concepts
                to add interactivity to the webpage. I learned about the
                Document Object Model and how to access particular html
                elements using selector queries. Managing and manipulating
                data required understanding data types and which data
                structures were best suited for the task. With the information
                stored, the data values could be rearranged using in-built
                methods, or constructing functions myself. Comparison and
                logical operations were performed to render a desired output
                or response.

                links between one-to-many tables to access specific fields.
                Interesting to see how the database system can efficiently
                sift through large datasets to return the specific field
                entries. Built a fictitious database, creating relations
                between the tables and ran queries to output the desired
                results. During the course, we practiced how to update and
                delete records using the graphical user interface and command
                line within mySQL WorkBench. Developing database management
                skills has proven to me its value when managing client and

                Use of python helped to consolidate programming concepts of
                data types, primitive and complex data structures,
                manipulation using built-in methods and imported modules. It
                was evident how versatile the language is, what was learned
                was a taster to the many applications that Python can provide.

              destinations that I have been fortunate enough to visit. The
              pages were created using HTML and CSS as I wanted to learn
              in-depth about class selection, inheritance and structuring
              layout for different screen sizes as well adding the personal
              aesthetic touches.

                excellent source for learning computer languages. Shaun delivers the content in bite-size, manageable
                chunks and strives to keep the lessons up to date and relevant. It's great for learning when you are
                short of time or looking for a mini-project to apply the skills being learned. You can access most of
                the videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja" target="blank">Youtube</a> but I am sure
                that the Net
